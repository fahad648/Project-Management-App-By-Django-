Using Python Django Web Framework for implementing this project. 


• Created 3 Models using python Django Framework.


• From Those Three models, two should have Primary-Key and Foreign-Key relation

• Data is saved from Web FORM, not from Django Admin Site.

• For this I'm Using Crispy Forms


• Used SQLite Database for model migration.


• Use Bootstrap to Stylize The Template
